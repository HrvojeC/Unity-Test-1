## Unity Test 1
This is Unity project made as a skill test:

* Side view 2D game
* Spawning red and blue boxes on random positions in scene
* Character picks up boxes and stores them in proper containers

### Dependencies
Unity Version: 2019.4.10f1, whole project folder is uploaded, all you need to run this project is proper version of Unity

### Controls
There are no direct ingame controls.
The only indirect control is "Box Spawn Rate" which can be found in script component attached on the "Main Camera" object. It means how much
time (in seconds) will pass until next box is spawned.

### Upgrade ideas
* Two or more characters in scene without conflicts
