## Unity Test 1
This is Unity project made as a skill test:

* Side view 2D game
* Spawning red and blue boxes on random positions in scene
* Character picks boxes and stores them in proper containers

### Dependencies
Unity Version: 2019.4.10f1
Whole project is uploaded, all you need to run it is proper version of Unity

### Controls
There are no direct ingame controls.
The only indirect control is "Box Spawn Rate" which can be found
in script component attached on "Main Camera" object. It tells how much
time (in seconds) will pass until next box is spawned.

### Upgrade ideas
* Having two or more characters in scene without conflicts
